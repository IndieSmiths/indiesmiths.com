# The Indie Smiths project

<div class="mt-4 p-5 bg-primary text-white rounded">
  <h3 class="text-white" style="margin-top:0px;">Our goal</h3>
  <p>The Indie Smiths project aims to promote and provide fun, learning and value by publishing and maintaining open-source apps, games and related content.</p>
</div>

<br />

Currently, most of our software is made in <img class="inline-icon25px" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon@latest/icons/python/python-original.svg" alt="Python logo" title="Python programming language" /> [Python](https://python.org), but we are gradually employing other languages as well, like <img class="inline-icon25px" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon@latest/icons/rust/rust-original.svg" alt="Rust logo" title="Rust programming language" /> [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), in order to add to our toolset, expand our skill set and bring even more people and talent to our community.

Under the hood, the Indie Smiths project is just a fancy name for the collection of public domain apps and games created and maintained by me ([Kennedy Richard S. Guerra](https://kennedyrichard.com)).

In practice, we are much more: although we are not a formal organization, our tools, games and content bring together a lot of people with different interests and talent, and make waves in the fields of development and design of apps and games.


## Our flagship project: Nodezator

Our flagship project, Nodezator, the <img class="inline-icon25px" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon@latest/icons/python/python-original.svg" alt="Python logo" title="Python programming language" /> Python node editor ([website](https://nodezator.com) | [GitHub repo](https://github.com/IndieSmiths/nodezator)) already has more than [100K downloads](https://pepy.tech/projects/nodezator) and a couple thousand stars ‚≠ê.

<img class="mx-auto d-block img-fluid mb-4" style="width:960px" src="https://i.imgur.com/lFjcSS4.png" alt="Nodezator screenshot" />

It has even been featured in an [80.lv article](https://80.lv/articles/this-might-be-the-cutest-way-to-visualize-python-node-editor-connections/).


## Many other projects

The Indie Smiths projects has many other projects in current development, most at the early stages of development, but active serious projects that get updates from time to time. Please, check our list of [apps and games](/apps-games.html) to learn about each of them.

Some fun and interesting projects worth mentioning in advance are...

The Bionic Blue game, made in <img class="inline-icon25px" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon@latest/icons/python/python-original.svg" alt="Python logo" title="Python programming language" /> Python, a 2D action platformer (still at an early stage of development):

Our first <img class="inline-icon25px" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon@latest/icons/rust/rust-original.svg" alt="Rust logo" title="Rust programming language" /> Rust game project, the Shmup game, a 2D shoot'em up game (also at an early stage of development, barely a prototype):

An app builder application called myappmaker (working title), made in <img class="inline-icon25px" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon@latest/icons/python/python-original.svg" alt="Python logo" title="Python programming language" /> Python, where you can insert widgets by drawing (again, very early development stages):
