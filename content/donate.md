## Benefits

Supporting us with a recurring donation gives you access to **exclusive discord channels** and **voting rights** on specific pools related to our apps/game projects.

Recurring donation options other than patreon are likely to apply a smaller fee in comparison. If you opt for a recurring donation other than patreon, talk to me on discord so I can set up your discord benefit.

Github sponsors and Ko-fi also offer recurring crowdfunding. Since such platforms are great for one time donations, expect to see links to them spread throughout Indie Smiths content in strategic non-disrupting spots.


## More donation methods

If there is another method of your preference, please, contact us by [email](mailto:kennedy@kennedyrichard.com) (kennedy@kennedyrichard.com) so that we can discuss it and maybe even make the method available here.


<h2 id="donations-via-pix">One-time donations via PIX (only in Brazil)</h2>

This option is only available in Brazil, which is why the rest of this subsection is in Brazilian Portuguese.
